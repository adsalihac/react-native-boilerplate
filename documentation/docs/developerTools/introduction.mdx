# Introduction

Debugging is an essential aspect of developing mobile apps. Android Studio and
Xcode both provide helpful tools for viewing logs, but there are more suitable
tools for debugging React Native apps.

We use
[React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger),
which is a standalone Mac that connects to the debug version of the app.

It provides additional functionality, including the Redux developer tools that
allows directly modifying the app state.

It is also possible to use [Flipper](flipper) to debug the app - it is now
the preferred way to debug React Native apps.
