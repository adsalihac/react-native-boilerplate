# Unit Testing

The project uses jest for unit testing and enforces a 100% coverage threshold.

When adding a new component, it is essential to add comprehensive tests
including, but not limited to, snapshot testing.

Many libraries do not work well with unit tests and must have mocks to test the
functionality surrounding them. Mocks reside in the `__mocks__` directory or are
implemented using `jest.mock` for mocking on a per-test basis.

Snapshot testing does not cover every aspect but is a good foundation. When
snapshots change, be sure to inspect them before updating them using
`npm test -- -u`.
