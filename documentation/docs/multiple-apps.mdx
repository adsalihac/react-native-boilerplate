# Multiple App

Our system is providing to implement multiple apps in a single codebase. So we can implement multiple apps in a different package and other model. Easy to maintain codebase and well structured.

- Example

  - Food Delivery App
  - FoodApp need delivery app , Shop app , Customer app , Driver app , Admin app. So here we can implement all apps in a single codebase.
  - Actually our project is configured with 2 brands. that is 'brand1' and 'brand2'.
  - If you want to implement more brands, you can add more brands , otherwise only 1 brand is enough.
