# Configuration

import Android from "./android.mdx";
import IOS from "./ios.mdx";
import Animation from "@site/src/components/Animation";
import AppBrandInputBrand from "@site/src/components/AppBrand/InputBrand";
import Env from "@site/src/components/CodeBlock/Env";
import AppBrand from "@site/src/components/AppBrand/AppBrand";
import Appname from "@site/src/components/Appname/Appname";
import EnvFile from "@site/src/components/CodeBlock/EnvFile";

Actually our system have implement multiple app models. So we can implement more apps in a different package and other model.
in this project we have 3 different apps. So we have 3 different env files. You can check the `env folder` in the `root directory`.

Actually we call the app as `brand1`. `brand1` is a product type of our system. currently we only implement single app in this project.

## Configuration Brand Name

So you can change the brand name , enter the brand name in the input field below.

<AppBrandInputBrand />

## Configuration Environment Files

our project is configured default 3 environment models are:

- `development` - The development environment is used when you run your app locally on your development machine.
- `production` - The production environment is used when you run your app on a production server.
- `live` - The live environment is used when you run your app on a live server. it is a user facing environment.

The `env` directory contains configuration files for running the app in
different environments.

## Configuration Environment Variables in .env

Open the `scripts/generate-environments` file in the root directory of your project.

<EnvFile />

Copy and paste the above code in the `scripts/generate-environments` file .after you need to run the script to generate the environment files.

```bash
npm run generate:environments
```

After run the script you can find the `env` folder in the root directory.

<Env />

:::note
The env configuration is already added in this project. You can check the env folder. inside the <AppBrand/> you can find the env files.
:::

## update the environment values or add new environment values

Open the `scripts/generate-environments.ts` file in the root directory of your project.

change the `env` object values. and run the script to generate the environment files.

```bash
npm run generate
```

:::tip
Inside the script `RN_APP_NAME` is a android app name , You can change the app name through this script file . `RN_APP_ID` is a android app id. if you need to replace the app id you can change the app id through this script file. but keep <Appname packageName={true} background={true} /> this format for the app id. otherwise the app will not work properly.
:::

:::warning
Do not change direct the env files. because the env files are generated by the script.

## Mutiple Application in a single codebase

you can implement different type of apps in this project.

:::tip
If you want to build multiple apps like delivery , restaurant and userApp in a single codebase. repeat above steps for each app. add another brand name.
:::

## Environment

- generate-environments need to add another `brandConfig` objects in files and run script

## Android

- in our system we are using brand1 is default android configuration. so android
  configuration is existing brand <AppBrand background={true}/> is same as `src/main`. it is a first brand only.
- if you want to add another brand in android. you need to create a new folder in `src/main` and copy all files from `src/main/brand1` to `src/main/brand2` and replace all brand1 to brand2 in all files.

Our system is providing to implement multiple apps in a single codebase. So we can implement multiple apps in a different package and other model. Easy to maintain codebase and well structured.

- Example

  - Food Delivery App
  - FoodApp need delivery app , Shop app , Customer app , Driver app , Admin app. So here we can implement all apps in a single codebase.
  - Actually our project is configured with 2 brands. that is 'brand1' and 'brand2'.
  - If you want to implement more brands, you can add more brands , otherwise only 1 brand is enough.
