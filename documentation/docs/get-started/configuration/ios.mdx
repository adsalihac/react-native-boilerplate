## Environment variable Configuration

We use `react-native-config` for env, follow steps for configuration

- Read variables declared in `.env` from your Obj-C classes like:

```objc
// import header
#import "RNCConfig.h"

// then read individual keys like:
NSString *apiUrl = [RNCConfig envFor:@"API_URL"];

// or just fetch the whole config
NSDictionary *config = [RNCConfig env];
```

- With one extra step environment values can be exposed to `Info.plist` and Build settings in the native project.

  - Click on the file tree and create new file of type XCConfig

  - Save it under `ios` folder as `Config.xcconfig` with the following content:

    ```objc
    #include? "tmp.xcconfig"
    ```

  - Add the following to your `.gitignore`:

    ```shell
    # react-native-config codegen
    ios/tmp.xcconfig
    ```

  - Apply config to your configurations

  - Go to Edit scheme... -> Build -> Pre-actions, click + and select New Run Script Action. Paste below code which will generate `tmp.xcconfig` before each build exposing values to Build Settings and `Info.plist`.

    ```shell
    exec > "${PROJECT_DIR}/pre-build.log" 2>&1
    "${PROJECT_DIR}/build-scripts/pre-build.sh" "${ENVFILE}"
    ```

## Setup target for two or more brands

- Create a New Group in Xcode and rename into your brand name (here we give name as Brand2)

- Create the duplicate of your app & rename to your brand (here we give name as brand2)

- While duplicating you got `copy Info.plist` rename to `Info.plist` and move this into group that we created earlier (Try to copy paste don't drag and drop, it will move only the reference)

- Make sure the `Info.plist` path is correct in build settings and run `pod install`

- Get app name from env by adding `$(RN_APP_NAME)` in bundle display name

## To generate Xcode schemes for each environment.

```shell
npm run generate:schemes
```

- We using a template `config/template.xcscheme` to generate the scheme
- You can customize the scheme by editing this file `scripts/generate-schemes.ts`
- If you see `xcuserdata` folder in `ios/xcule.xcodeproj` you can remove it and also `IDEWorkspaceChecks.plist` from `ios/xcule.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata`
- If you need only one target you can remove `brand2` from Xcode and from `scripts/generate-schemes.ts` then run `npm run generate:schemes` so it will generate scheme for one target.

## Scripts to run different environment

```shell
npm run start:ios:brand1:dev
```

```shell
npm run start:ios:brand1:prod
```

```shell
npm run start:ios:brand2:dev
```

```shell
npm run start:ios:brand2:prod
```
