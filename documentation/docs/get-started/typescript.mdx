# TypeScript Support

TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft, and was first released in 2012. TypeScript adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming concepts to JavaScript, making it easier to develop large-scale applications.

With TypeScript, developers can catch errors and bugs during development, rather than discovering them at runtime. It also provides features like interfaces, generics, and type annotations, which help improve code readability and maintainability. TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript code, which can then be run in any browser or environment that supports JavaScript.

TypeScript has become increasingly popular among developers, especially those working with larger codebases, because of its ability to catch errors early and improve code quality. It is widely used in many popular frameworks and libraries, such as Angular, React, and Vue.js.

## Learn TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it is easy to learn if you already know JavaScript. You can learn TypeScript by reading the [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) , or by taking a course on TypeScript on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?closed_captions=en&features=has_closed_caption&instructional_level=all&lang=en&q=typescript&ratings=4.5&sort=most-reviewed&src=ukw).
